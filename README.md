# DefenseBot--2022-Rapid-React-Build-
## ToDo
- Add Slew to command
- Characterization I think I need to give all motors voltage! Or maybe try controller groups?
- Check Odometry (conversions, gear set correctly, etc., )
- Check Gyro/angle 
- Auto Drive and trajectory
- Kinematics, PID, and Odemetry (consider SwerveBot setup and CTRE configs)
